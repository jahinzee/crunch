# crunch
Compile and run C files with one quick "crunch"!

## Disclaimer

This script was developed as a quick bodge, for my university's C practicals. This is probably not the most secure, practical, or otherwise "good" way to do this type of thing, and if you need to use something like this for a production environment, it's probably best to use an IDE.

## Usage:

- `crunch <filename> (r/q)`
  - `r`: Execute output file.
  - `q`: Exit crunch without executing the file.
- `crunch --help`
