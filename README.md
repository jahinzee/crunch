# crunch
Compile and run C files with one quick "crunch"!

## Disclaimer

This script was developed as a quick bodge, something to make writing and testing C code easier for me. This is probably not the most secure, practical, or otherwise "good" way to do this type of thing, and if you need to use something like this for a production environment, it's probably best to use an IDE.

## Usage

- `crunch <filename> (r/q)`
  - `r`: Execute output file.
  - `q`: Exit crunch without executing the file.
- `crunch --help`
